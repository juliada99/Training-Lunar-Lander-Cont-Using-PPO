# Training-Lunar-Lander-Cont-Using-PPO
This project uses PPO to train the Lunar Lander with continuous action space. To adjust parameters go inside the code.\
Implementation is in Tensorflow 2.1.0 and Python 2.7.17.\

To run training: ```python train.py```\
To run testing on my trained policy: ```python test.py```\
To access train run plots ```tensorboard --logdir logs/train```\
To access test run rewards ```tensorboard --logdir logs/test```
